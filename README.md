# inzoom
A quick Zoom IN Meeting Monitor for use with an Raspberry Pi.  There  are already a bunch of there out there I am sure but I like groovy so I threw together a quick version for my own amusement and personal comfort!

I wrote this script to call a Ras-Pi and trigger a little REST endpoint to toggle an on the air light.  On the Rasp-Pi I'm using the service mentione dhere in [Easyprogramming's](https://aiim.easyprogramming.net/) great write up on how to do this.

To Run the script
-----------------
Assuming you have Groovy installed: 
```groovy monitor/meetingCheck.groovy```

Need groovy installed? Check out [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/), it can install and manage things like this without all the usual windows frustration.

Scheduling the Script
